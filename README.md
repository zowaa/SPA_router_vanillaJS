## More about the project
An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.

My project consists of 3 simple  pages “Home, About and contact us” , every time a link is clicked  the body content is reloaded without loading an entire new page.
